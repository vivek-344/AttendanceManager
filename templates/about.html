                        <p>Welcome to Attendance Manager! I’m Vivek, a developer passionate about creating tools that streamline everyday processes. Attendance Manager is a project I developed specifically to meet the needs of my department, designed to simplify attendance tracking, optimize management, and enhance productivity with its intuitive and reliable features.</p>
                        <p>With a background in Information Technology, I’ve gained hands-on experience through an internship with Cisco Networking Academy, where I first delved into Computer Networking. Over time, I’ve developed an interest in technologies like Python, GoLang, microservices, DevOps practices, and AWS, gaining foundational knowledge in these areas. Tackling over 250 LeetCode problems has sharpened my problem-solving skills and fueled my drive to explore new solutions.</p>
                        <p>Attendance Manager is a reflection of my journey—a commitment to turning challenges into opportunities and using technology to create meaningful impact. Thank you for being part of this journey!</p>
